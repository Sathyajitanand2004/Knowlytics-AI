        2. JSON Format: All MCQs should be formatted in a JSON object where:
            - The main object is titled `"Mcq"`.
            - Each MCQ is represented as a nested object with a numerical key (e.g., `"1"`, `"2"`, `"3"`), and its value is the structured MCQ.

        3. Difficulty Distribution:
            - 50 percentage of the questions should be easy, covering basic and fundamental aspects of the topic.
            - 30 percentage of the questions should be of medium difficulty, requiring some understanding of concepts.
            - 15 percentage of the questions should be hard, involving complex applications of knowledge.
            - 5 percentage of the questions should be super hard, challenging the user with advanced and tricky concepts.

        4. Customization Based on Input:
            - The number of MCQs must be based on the userâ€™s request.
            - The topic should align with the subject area provided by the user.

        5. Example Format:
            {{
                "Mcq": {{
                    "1": {{
